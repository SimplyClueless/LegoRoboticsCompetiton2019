Term 2 - Digital Technology Assessment
# About
These are the JavaScript files and codes that are being used on our EV3 robot for our Digital Technology (Term 2) assessment. The LineFollowingMaster is the main, polished program that will be uploaded to the robot once all changes have been made and the code has been tested. The LineFollowTestBranch is where segments and fragments of the code are tested and changed seperate from the main code. This is mainly to test if an idea that we have will work better than what we currently have working without breaking the functioning code on the EV3, avoiding backwards progress. Code may be transferred from the Test Branch to the Master once it has been tested and verified to be functional.
